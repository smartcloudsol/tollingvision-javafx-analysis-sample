# Task 16 Implementation Summary

## Enhanced Token Selection with Front and Custom Token Propagation

This implementation addresses all requirements from Requirement 12 in the specification:

### 1. Front Token Detection (Requirement 12.1)
✅ **Enhanced FilenameTokenizer** to better detect front tokens with synonyms:
- Added `isFrontToken()` method to detect: front, f, fr, forward (case-insensitive)
- Added `getImageRoleForToken()` method to map tokens to ImageRole
- Enhanced `analyzeCameraSide()` method for better detection
- Front tokens are properly classified as `TokenType.CAMERA_SIDE`

### 2. Pre-configured Custom Tokens (Requirement 12.2)
✅ **Created CustomTokenManager** with pre-configured tokens:
- Lane identifiers: lane1, lane2, l1, l2, etc.
- Direction indicators: nb, sb, eb, wb, north, south, east, west
- Station identifiers: sta1, sta2, station1, station2
- Violation types: speed, redlight, toll, hov, violation
- Custom tokens are automatically applied during token analysis
- Enhanced TokenSelectionPane to use CustomTokenManager

### 3. Custom Token Dialog Control (Requirement 12.3)
✅ **Implemented dialog showing logic**:
- Added `hasCustomTokenDialogBeenShown()` flag to prevent multiple dialogs
- Created `CustomTokenDialog` for managing custom tokens
- Dialog only shows when switching to Simple mode for the first time
- Added `showCustomTokenDialogIfNeeded()` method to SimplePatternBuilder
- Integrated with PatternBuilderDialog mode switching

### 4. Prevent Unexpected Dialogs (Requirement 12.4)
✅ **Controlled dialog behavior**:
- Dialog flag prevents unexpected dialogs during normal navigation
- Only shows when explicitly switching from Advanced to Simple mode
- No dialogs during normal Simple mode navigation or Advanced mode usage

### 5. Front Token Propagation to Roles Step (Requirement 12.5)
✅ **Enhanced RoleRulesPane** with suggestion system:
- Added `suggestRulesFromTokens()` method to analyze detected tokens
- Automatically suggests rules for front tokens (and other camera/side tokens)
- Visual suggestions box with "Add" buttons for quick rule creation
- Integrated with SimplePatternBuilder to call suggestions when tokens update

## Key Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `CustomTokenManager.java` - Manages custom token definitions and application
- `CustomTokenDialog.java` - UI for managing custom tokens
- `CustomTokenManagerTest.java` - Tests for custom token functionality
- `FilenameTokenizerEnhancementTest.java` - Tests for enhanced tokenizer
- `Task16IntegrationTest.java` - Integration tests for all requirements

### Enhanced Files:
- `FilenameTokenizer.java` - Added front token detection methods
- `TokenSelectionPane.java` - Enhanced with custom token support and front token highlighting
- `SimplePatternBuilder.java` - Integrated custom token manager and dialog logic
- `PatternBuilderDialog.java` - Added custom token dialog showing on mode switch
- `RoleRulesPane.java` - Added rule suggestion system based on detected tokens

## Testing

All requirements have been thoroughly tested:
- ✅ 5 new test classes with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ All tests passing (18 new tests)
- ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved (no breaking changes)

## Visual Enhancements

- Front tokens are highlighted with special border styling in TokenSelectionPane
- Enhanced tooltips show front token detection and custom token information
- Rule suggestions appear in a blue-highlighted box in RoleRulesPane
- Custom token dialog provides intuitive management interface

## Usage Flow

1. **Token Analysis**: FilenameTokenizer detects front tokens and applies custom tokens
2. **Token Selection**: Enhanced TokenSelectionPane shows front tokens with special highlighting
3. **Custom Tokens**: When switching to Simple mode, custom token dialog appears once
4. **Rule Suggestions**: RoleRulesPane automatically suggests rules for detected front tokens
5. **Propagation**: Front tokens carry through to role configuration with proper ImageRole mapping

This implementation fully satisfies all aspects of Task 16 and Requirement 12, providing a seamless experience for users working with vehicle images that include front-facing cameras and custom token patterns.
